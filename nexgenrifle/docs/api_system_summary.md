# NexGen Rifle Builder API System

## Overview

The API system is designed to facilitate intelligent interaction between LLMs and the NexGen Rifle Builder platform. It uses ProfileTypes as a source of truth for model interaction and supports complex operations through a batch processing system.

## Key Components

### 1. ProfileType Model
- Serves as metadata repository for models
- Defines required fields and data structures
- Provides API documentation and examples
- Includes conversation analysis data for LLMs
- Stores error guidance and common queries

### 2. API Controller
- Supports standard CRUD operations
- Implements HATEOAS links
- Handles batch operations
- Uses transaction support
- Validates permissions and data

### 3. ResponseTransformer
- Formats responses based on ProfileType definitions
- Ensures consistent data structure
- Adds HATEOAS links
- Handles nested relationships

### 4. BatchRequest Handler
- Processes multiple operations in one request
- Supports cross-operation references
- Maintains data consistency through transactions
- Validates operation sequences

## Flow of Operation

1. LLM queries ProfileType for model information:
```http
GET /api/profile-types?name=rifle-build
```

2. LLM receives model metadata including:
- Required fields
- Allowed operations
- Response structure
- Example API calls

3. LLM can then construct valid requests:
```http
POST /api/batch
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "POST",
            "resource": "rifle-builds",
            "data": {/* structured according to ProfileType */}
        }
    ]
}
```

## Integration Points

### For LLMs
- Use ProfileType metadata to understand models
- Follow HATEOAS links for navigation
- Use batch operations for complex tasks
- Reference error guidance for problem-solving

### For Frontend
- Consistent API response format
- Predictable error handling
- Built-in relationship handling
- Transaction support for data integrity

### For Backend
- Centralized permission management
- Standardized data transformation
- Flexible batch processing
- Extensible through ProfileTypes

## Example Use Cases

1. Creating a new rifle build with parts:
```json
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "POST",
            "resource": "rifle-builds",
            "data": {
                "title": "Custom Build",
                "build_category_id": 1
            }
        },
        {
            "method": "POST",
            "resource": "rifle-items",
            "data": {
                "rifle_build_id": "{response.0.id}",
                "product_id": 123
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Adding a new vendor and product:
```json
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "POST",
            "resource": "vendors",
            "data": {
                "name": "New Vendor"
            }
        },
        {
            "method": "POST",
            "resource": "products",
            "data": {
                "vendor_id": "{response.0.id}",
                "title": "New Product"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
